## Description
This app uses MongoDB and Mongoose to create a social network database where you can create users, users can create thoughts, any user can add a reaction to a thought, and you can even add friends. The database also uses virtuals to keep track of reaction count and friend count for each user. This was a fun way to learn how to use MongoDd with express. Here is a video showing the functionality of each route tested in Insomnia : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK0HIb-uZUAF2Drqy3j0Hfs7maXQ8hrp/view?usp=sharing
